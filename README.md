# Real_Article_Identification_System

#The idea for the project was to find the actuality of user submitted articles. We planned on creating a chrome extension that would allow any user to 
  implement our program to a chosen article. Our program would then evaluate the "realness" of the article based on finding relationships between the label and the content
  (text) of the article. By vectorizing the text, we were able to format x value implementations and decode them. After implementing a passive agressive modifier, we were able to
  predict the realness probability of any given article by comparing the test value data set with the  actaul value data set. 
 
#Although we were able to produce some form of similar probability (as shown in the attached pictures), we were unable to implement our test data and real data set results.
  Presented in our GitHub page is the seperate fake article identification system and the constructed chrome extension.
  
 #Throughout the project, we utilized python, html, json, css, and js.
